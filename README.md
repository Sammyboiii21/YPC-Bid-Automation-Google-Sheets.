The updateYPCSeenAndNewBids function automates the discovery of new construction bids listed on the Tri-City Plan Center's IPIN portal, using data scraped daily via Octoparse. It compares newly scraped data in the "Daily Pull YPC" sheet with previously recorded bids in the "Seen YPC" sheet to identify and extract new entries. These new bids are cleaned (e.g., converting project names into clickable hyperlinks), stored in both the "Seen YPC" and "New Bids YPC" sheets, and summarized in an HTML email sent to a designated recipient. This code was developed to automate the bid discovery workflow and has successfully reduced the time required to identify new bids by 90%.
