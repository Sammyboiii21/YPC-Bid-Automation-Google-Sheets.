This script reduces bid discovery time by 90% by automating how Yakima Planning Center bids are ingested, cleaned, filtered, and shared. It opens the active spreadsheet and targets three tabs: Daily Pull YPC (raw import), Seen YPC (cumulative log), and New Bids YPC (current filtered list). It validates required columns (Project_ID, Project_Link, Project, State, City), then builds a set of already-seen IDs from Seen YPC. From the daily pull, it keeps only rows with new Project_IDs, converts Project into a clickable HYPERLINK(Project_Link, Project), and removes Project_Link from the output. Headers are mirrored without the link column, and the cleaned, unfiltered new rows are appended to Seen YPC. For distribution, it filters those new rows to Washington (State = “WA”) and excludes a case-insensitive list of specified cities/counties, producing New Bids YPC. It then composes a concise HTML email summarizing these WA-only new bids (with linked Project), sends it to the recipients, and finally clears the Daily Pull YPC tab to reset the staging area.
